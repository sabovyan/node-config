# Create Lib app

## Motivation

I always like to play with new tech and tools. And this is a small project to skip some configuration steps when creating a new library.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sabovyan/node-config.git


```

```bash
cd node-config
```

```bash
npm link
```

## Usage

```bash
node-setup
```
